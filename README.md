Trying out Monte Carlo algorytm 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm

Applied for custom made "gym". Gym is made to replicate War3 map "https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/mazing-contest-v3-0.294570/".
This is my first step towards creating self learning neural network, which is trained for playing this particular mode.

+ Visualization of map, and PC moves by CV2 + PIL.
